WebToys
=======

WebToys is a collection of simple HTML toys/learning-tools
that let children explore some particular aspect of a topic.
They are intended for use as part of a teacher-led exploration,
rather than as stand-alone toys/tools.

The toys are targetted at JK-level students, as that's my child's
class.

Current Toys:

- [Counting By](http://www.vrplumber.com/webtoys/countingby/) click numbers to see counting-by that number
- [Multiple Factors](http://www.vrplumber.com/webtoys/1/) shows factors and multiples for the clicked number
