WebToys
=======

WebToys is a collection of simple HTML toys/learning-tools
that let children explore some particular aspect of a topic.
They are intended for use as part of a teacher-led exploration,
rather than as stand-alone toys/tools.

The toys are targetted at JK-level students, as that's my child's
class.

You can view all of the toys online at:
